In the past module, we got to know some essential aspects of programming in
Ruby: class variables and methods. You can do a quick check of the list of
topics we covered:

- How to recognize a class variable
- How to utilize class variables
- How to know when to use `attr_accessor`
- How to know when to define private methods
